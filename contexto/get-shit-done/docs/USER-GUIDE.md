## Slash-command forms (hyphen vs colon)

GSD ships **the same set of skills** to every supported runtime, but two slash-form spellings are in play:

- **Hyphen form** — `/gsd-command-name` — used by Claude Code, Copilot, OpenCode, Kilo, Cursor, Windsurf, Augment, Antigravity, and Trae.
- **Colon form** — `/gsd:command-name` — used by **Gemini CLI only**. Gemini namespaces every plugin's commands under the plugin id, so the install path rewrites every body-text reference and command file to the colon form during `--gemini` install.

You don't need to choose — the installer writes the correct form into the command directory of each runtime you target. When following a walkthrough on a Gemini terminal, replace the hyphen after `gsd` with a colon as you read each slash command.

## Namespace routing primer (`gsd:<namespace>`, v1.40)

v1.40 ships six **namespace meta-skills** as the first-stage entry points for hierarchical routing — they keep the eager skill-listing token cost low (~120 tokens for 6 routers vs ~2,150 for a flat 86-skill listing) while every concrete sub-skill remains directly invocable. Each namespace router's body contains a routing table that maps your intent to the correct concrete sub-skill.

| Namespace | Router | Routes to |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Phase pipeline | `/gsd-workflow` | discuss / plan / execute / verify / phase / progress |
| Project lifecycle | `/gsd-project` | milestones, audits, summary |
| Quality gates | `/gsd-quality` | code review, debug, audit, security, eval, ui |
| Codebase intelligence | `/gsd-context` | map, graphify, docs, learnings |
| Management | `/gsd-manage` | config, workspace, workstreams, thread, update, ship, inbox |
| Exploration & capture | `/gsd-ideate` | explore, sketch, spike, spec, capture |

You almost never need to type a namespace router yourself. Their value is in the routing layer the model uses to discover the right sub-skill — they exist so the system prompt can list 6 entries instead of 86. If you already know the concrete command (e.g. `/gsd-plan-phase`), call it directly.

## End-to-End Walkthrough

This walkthrough shows how GSD phases connect for a typical single-phase project — a small Node.js REST API that validates webhook signatures. Follow it to understand what each command does, what it creates, and how the next command consumes it.

### 1. Create the project

```
/gsd-new-project
```

GSD asks questions about your idea, spawns parallel research agents, extracts requirements, and creates a roadmap. You approve the roadmap before any code is written.

**Example output (abridged):**

```
> What are you building?
  A webhook signature validator middleware for Express apps.

> Who's the user?
  Backend developers integrating third-party webhooks (Stripe, GitHub, Shopify).

[Research agents run in parallel...]
[Requirements extracted...]

Roadmap (1 phase):
  Phase 1 — Core middleware: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation,
             timing-safe compare, configurable tolerance window.

Approve? [y/n]
```

**What gets created:**

```
.planning/
  PROJECT.md          # "Webhook validator middleware — Express, HMAC-SHA256..."
  REQUIREMENTS.md     # REQ-001: Validate signature header; REQ-002: Timing-safe...
  ROADMAP.md          # Phase 1 status: pending
  STATE.md            # Session memory, current position
```

`ROADMAP.md` excerpt:
```markdown
## Phase 1 — Core middleware
**Status:** pending
**Goal:** HMAC-SHA256 signature validation with timing-safe compare and a
configurable replay-protection tolerance window.
**Requirements:** REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003
```

### 2. Discuss and plan the phase

```
/gsd-discuss-phase 1
```

GSD reads the phase goal and asks about your implementation preferences before any planning happens. This is where you shape *how* it builds — not just *what* it builds.

```
> How should invalid signatures be handled?
  Reject immediately with 401, log the raw header for debugging.

> Should the tolerance window be configurable per-route or global?
  Global config, but allow per-route override via middleware options.

> Any library preferences for HMAC?
  Node built-in crypto only — no extra dependencies.
```

**What gets created:** `.planning/phases/01-core-middleware/CONTEXT.md`

`CONTEXT.md` excerpt:
```markdown
## Implementation Decisions
- Invalid signatures → 401, log raw header
- Tolerance window → global default, per-route override via options object
- HMAC library → Node built-in crypto (no external deps)
- Error format → { error: "invalid_signature", ts: <epoch> }
```

Now plan the phase:

```
/gsd-plan-phase 1
```

GSD spawns four parallel research agents (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls), then a planner reads `CONTEXT.md` + research findings and creates atomic task plans. A plan-checker verifies each plan achieves the phase goal before saving.

**What gets created:**

```
.planning/phases/01-core-middleware/
  RESEARCH.md         # Findings: crypto.timingSafeEqual docs, replay attack patterns...
  01-01-PLAN.md       # Task: create validateSignature() core function
  01-02-PLAN.md       # Task: Express middleware wrapper + error handling
```

`01-01-PLAN.md` excerpt:
```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create validateSignature core function</name>
  <files>src/validate.js, src/validate.test.js</files>
  <action>
    Use crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex').
    Compare with crypto.timingSafeEqual() — never === or ==.
    Accept tolerance window in ms; reject if |timestamp - now| exceeds it.
  </action>
  <verify>npm test -- --grep "validateSignature"</verify>
  <done>All timing-safe comparison tests pass; replay outside window returns false</done>
</task>
```

### 3. Execute

```
/gsd-execute-phase 1
```

GSD groups plans into waves (parallel where independent, sequential where dependent), spawns a fresh 200k-context executor per plan, and commits each task atomically.

```
Wave 1 (parallel):
  [Executor A] → 01-01-PLAN.md (core function)  ✓ committed
  [Executor B] → 01-02-PLAN.md (middleware)      ✓ committed

[Verifier] Checking codebase against phase goals...
  REQ-001 validateSignature() ✓
  REQ-002 timing-safe compare ✓
  REQ-003 tolerance window    ✓
  Status: PASS
```

**Git history after execution:**

```
a1b2c3d feat(01-01): implement validateSignature with timingSafeEqual
d4e5f6g feat(01-02): add Express middleware wrapper and 401 error format
h7i8j9k chore(01): phase 1 verification — all requirements met
```

**What gets created:**

```
.planning/phases/01-core-middleware/
  01-01-SUMMARY.md    # "Implemented validateSignature(), 47 lines, tests passing"
  01-02-SUMMARY.md    # "Middleware wraps validator, logs raw header on 401"
  VERIFICATION.md     # REQ-001 ✓, REQ-002 ✓, REQ-003 ✓ — PASS
```

`STATE.md` is updated automatically to reflect the new phase status:

```markdown
## Current Position
Phase 1 — Core middleware: executed, pending verify
```

### 4. Verify

```
/gsd-verify-work 1
```

GSD extracts testable deliverables from the phase goal and walks you through them one at a time.

```
[1/3] Can you require the middleware and pass it to an Express route?
> yes

[2/3] Does a request with a valid signature return 200?
> yes

[3/3] Does a request with an invalid signature return 401 with { error: "invalid_signature" }?
> no — I'm getting a 500 instead

[Diagnosing...]
Root cause: middleware catches crypto.timingSafeEqual TypeError when
buffers are different lengths. Fix: normalize to same length before compare.

Fix plan created: .planning/phases/01-core-middleware/01-03-PLAN.md
Run /gsd-execute-phase 1 to apply.
```

After re-running execute and re-verifying:

```
All 3 checks passed. Phase 1 verified.
```

**What gets created:** `.planning/phases/01-core-middleware/UAT.md`

### What's next

Once a phase is verified, ship it:

```
/gsd-ship 1          # Creates a PR with auto-generated body
```

The PR body always includes the required GSD sections: `Summary`, `Changes`, `Requirements Addressed`, `Verification`, and `Key Decisions`. During `/gsd-new-project`, you can also enable optional PRD-style sections such as user stories, acceptance criteria, risks, release criteria, and stakeholder approval. These are appended through `ship.pr_body_sections` and do not change the required core sections.

For setup examples, field definitions, and troubleshooting, see [Custom PR Body Sections](ship-pr-body-sections.md).

For multi-phase projects, repeat the loop:

```
/gsd-discuss-phase 2
/gsd-plan-phase 2
/gsd-execute-phase 2
/gsd-verify-work 2
```

Or let GSD figure out the next step automatically:

```
/gsd-progress --next
```

When all phases are done:

```
/gsd-audit-milestone     # Verify all requirements shipped
/gsd-complete-milestone  # Archive, tag release
```

**Relevant flags covered in this walkthrough:**

| Flag | Command | When to use |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--auto` | `/gsd-new-project` | Skip interactive questions, ingest from a PRD file |
| `--research` | `/gsd-quick` | Add a research agent to an ad-hoc task |
| `--validate` | `/gsd-quick` | Add plan-checking and post-execution verification |

### Validation Architecture (Nyquist Layer)

During plan-phase research, GSD now maps automated test coverage to each phase
requirement before any code is written. This ensures that when Claude's executor
commits a task, a feedback mechanism already exists to verify it within seconds.

The researcher detects your existing test infrastructure, maps each requirement to
a specific test command, and identifies any test scaffolding that must be created
before implementation begins (Wave 0 tasks).

The plan-checker enforces this as an 8th verification dimension: plans where tasks
lack automated verify commands will not be approved.

**Output:** `{phase}-VALIDATION.md` -- the feedback contract for the phase.

**Disable:** Set `workflow.nyquist_validation: false` in `/gsd-settings` for
rapid prototyping phases where test infrastructure isn't the focus.

### Retroactive Validation (`/gsd-validate-phase`)

For phases executed before Nyquist validation existed, or for existing codebases
with only traditional test suites, retroactively audit and fill coverage gaps:

```
  /gsd-validate-phase N
         |
         +-- Detect state (VALIDATION.md exists? SUMMARY.md exists?)
         |
         +-- Discover: scan implementation, map requirements to tests
         |
         +-- Analyze gaps: which requirements lack automated verification?
         |
         +-- Present gap plan for approval
         |
         +-- Spawn auditor: generate tests, run, debug (max 3 attempts)
         |
         +-- Update VALIDATION.md
               |
               +-- COMPLIANT -> all requirements have automated checks
               +-- PARTIAL -> some gaps escalated to manual-only
```

The auditor never modifies implementation code — only test files and
VALIDATION.md. If a test reveals an implementation bug, it's flagged as an
escalation for you to address.

**When to use:** After executing phases that were planned before Nyquist was
enabled, or after `/gsd-audit-milestone` surfaces Nyquist compliance gaps.

### Assumptions Discussion Mode

By default, `/gsd-discuss-phase` asks open-ended questions about your implementation preferences. Assumptions mode inverts this: GSD reads your codebase first, surfaces structured assumptions about how it would build the phase, and asks only for corrections.

**Enable:** Set `workflow.discuss_mode` to `'assumptions'` via `/gsd-settings`.

**How it works:**

1. Reads PROJECT.md, codebase mapping, and existing conventions
2. Generates a structured list of assumptions (tech choices, patterns, file locations)
3. Presents assumptions for you to confirm, correct, or expand
4. Writes CONTEXT.md from confirmed assumptions

**When to use:**

- Experienced developers who already know their codebase well
- Rapid iteration where open-ended questions slow you down
- Projects where patterns are well-established and predictable

See [docs/workflow-discuss-mode.md](workflow-discuss-mode.md) for the full discuss-mode reference.

### Decision Coverage Gates

The discuss-phase captures implementation decisions in CONTEXT.md under a
`<decisions>` block as numbered bullets (`- **D-01:** …`). Two gates — added
for issue #2492 — ensure those decisions survive into plans and shipped
code.

**Plan-phase translation gate (blocking).** After planning, GSD refuses to
mark the phase planned until every trackable decision appears in at least
one plan's `must_haves`, `truths`, or body. The gate names each missed
decision by id (`D-07: …`) so you know exactly what to add, move, or
reclassify.

**Verify-phase validation gate (non-blocking).** During verification, GSD
searches plans, SUMMARY.md, modified files, and recent commit messages for
each trackable decision. Misses are logged to VERIFICATION.md as a warning
section; verification status is unchanged. The asymmetry is deliberate —
the blocking gate is cheap at plan time but hostile at verify time.

**Writing decisions the gate can match.** Two match modes:

1. **Strict id match (recommended).** Cite the decision id anywhere in a
   plan that implements it — `must_haves.truths: ["D-12: bit offsets
   exposed"]`, a bullet in the plan body, a frontmatter comment. This is
   deterministic and unambiguous.
2. **Soft phrase match (fallback).** If a 6+-word slice of the decision
   text appears verbatim in any plan or shipped artifact, it counts. This
   forgives paraphrasing but is less reliable.

**Opting a decision out.** If a decision genuinely should not be tracked —
an implementation-discretion note, an informational capture, a decision
already deferred — mark it one of these ways:

- Move it under the `### Claude's Discretion` heading inside `<decisions>`.
- Tag it in its bullet: `- **D-08 [informational]:** …`,
  `- **D-09 [folded]:** …`, `- **D-10 [deferred]:** …`.

**Disabling the gates.** Set
`workflow.context_coverage_gate: false` in `.planning/config.json` (or via
`/gsd-settings`) to skip both gates silently. Default is `true`.

---

## UI Design Contract

### Why

AI-generated frontends are visually inconsistent not because Claude Code is bad at UI but because no design contract existed before execution. Five components built without a shared spacing scale, color contract, or copywriting standard produce five slightly different visual decisions.

`/gsd-ui-phase` locks the design contract before planning. `/gsd-ui-review` audits the result after execution.

### Commands


| Command              | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/gsd-ui-phase [N]`  | Generate UI-SPEC.md design contract for a frontend phase |
| `/gsd-ui-review [N]` | Retroactive 6-pillar visual audit of implemented UI      |


### Workflow: `/gsd-ui-phase`

**When to run:** After `/gsd-discuss-phase`, before `/gsd-plan-phase` — for phases with frontend/UI work.

**Flow:**

1. Reads CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md, REQUIREMENTS.md for existing decisions
2. Detects design system state (shadcn components.json, Tailwind config, existing tokens)
3. shadcn initialization gate — offers to initialize if React/Next.js/Vite project has none
4. Asks only unanswered design contract questions (spacing, typography, color, copywriting, registry safety)
5. Writes `{phase}-UI-SPEC.md` to phase directory
6. Validates against 6 dimensions (Copywriting, Visuals, Color, Typography, Spacing, Registry Safety)
7. Revision loop if BLOCKED (max 2 iterations)

**Output:** `{padded_phase}-UI-SPEC.md` in `.planning/phases/{phase-dir}/`

### Workflow: `/gsd-ui-review`

**When to run:** After `/gsd-execute-phase` or `/gsd-verify-work` — for any project with frontend code.

**Standalone:** Works on any project, not just GSD-managed ones. If no UI-SPEC.md exists, audits against abstract 6-pillar standards.

**6 Pillars (scored 1-4 each):**

1. Copywriting — CTA labels, empty states, error states
2. Visuals — focal points, visual hierarchy, icon accessibility
3. Color — accent usage discipline, 60/30/10 compliance
4. Typography — font size/weight constraint adherence
5. Spacing — grid alignment, token consistency
6. Experience Design — loading/error/empty state coverage

**Output:** `{padded_phase}-UI-REVIEW.md` in phase directory with scores and top 3 priority fixes.

### Configuration


| Setting                   | Default | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow.ui_phase`       | `true`  | Generate UI design contracts for frontend phases            |
| `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | `true`  | plan-phase prompts to run /gsd-ui-phase for frontend phases |


Both follow the absent=enabled pattern. Disable via `/gsd-settings`.

### shadcn Initialization

For React/Next.js/Vite projects, the UI researcher offers to initialize shadcn if no `components.json` is found. The flow:

1. Visit `ui.shadcn.com/create` and configure your preset
2. Copy the preset string
3. Run `npx shadcn init --preset {paste}`
4. Preset encodes the entire design system — colors, border radius, fonts

The preset string becomes a first-class GSD planning artifact, reproducible across phases and milestones.

### Registry Safety Gate

Third-party shadcn registries can inject arbitrary code. The safety gate requires:

- `npx shadcn view {component}` — inspect before installing
- `npx shadcn diff {component}` — compare against official

Controlled by `workflow.ui_safety_gate` config toggle.

### Screenshot Storage

`/gsd-ui-review` captures screenshots via Playwright CLI to `.planning/ui-reviews/`. A `.gitignore` is created automatically to prevent binary files from reaching git. Screenshots are cleaned up during `/gsd-complete-milestone`.

---

## Spiking & Sketching

Use `/gsd-spike` to validate technical feasibility before planning, and `/gsd-sketch` to explore visual direction before designing. Both store artifacts in `.planning/` and integrate with the project-skills system via their wrap-up companions.

### When to Spike

Spike when you're uncertain whether a technical approach is feasible or want to compare two implementations before committing a phase to one of them.

/gsd-spike                              # Interactive intake — describes the question, you confirm
/gsd-spike "can we stream LLM tokens through SSE"
/gsd-spike --quick "websocket vs SSE latency"
```

Each spike runs 2–5 experiments. Every experiment has:
- A **Given / When / Then** hypothesis written before any code
- **Working code** (not pseudocode)
- A **VALIDATED / INVALIDATED / PARTIAL** verdict with evidence

Results land in `.planning/spikes/NNN-name/README.md` and are indexed in `.planning/spikes/MANIFEST.md`.

Once you have signal, run `/gsd-spike --wrap-up` to package the findings into `.claude/skills/spike-findings-[project]/` — future sessions will load them automatically via project-skills discovery.

### When to Sketch

Sketch when you need to compare layout structures, interaction models, or visual treatments before writing any real component code.

```
/gsd-sketch                             # Mood intake — explores feel, references, core action
/gsd-sketch "dashboard layout"
/gsd-sketch --quick "sidebar navigation"
/gsd-sketch --text "onboarding flow"    # For non-Claude runtimes (Codex, Gemini, etc.)
```

Each sketch answers **one design question** with 2–3 variants in a single `index.html` you open directly in a browser — no build step. Variants use tab navigation and shared CSS variables from `themes/default.css`. All interactive elements (hover, click, transitions) are functional.

After picking a winner, run `/gsd-sketch --wrap-up` to capture the visual decisions into `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-[project]/`.

### Spike → Sketch → Phase Flow

```
/gsd-spike "SSE vs WebSocket"     # Validate the approach
/gsd-spike --wrap-up              # Package learnings

/gsd-sketch "real-time feed UI"   # Explore the design
/gsd-sketch --wrap-up             # Package decisions

/gsd-discuss-phase N              # Lock in preferences (now informed by spike + sketch)
/gsd-plan-phase N                 # Plan with confidence
```

---

## Backlog & Threads

### Backlog Parking Lot

Ideas that aren't ready for active planning go into the backlog using 999.x numbering, keeping them outside the active phase sequence.

```
/gsd-capture --backlog "GraphQL API layer"     # Creates 999.1-graphql-api-layer/
/gsd-capture --backlog "Mobile responsive"     # Creates 999.2-mobile-responsive/
```

Backlog items get full phase directories, so you can use `/gsd-discuss-phase 999.1` to explore an idea further or `/gsd-plan-phase 999.1` when it's ready.

**Review and promote** with `/gsd-review-backlog` — it shows all backlog items and lets you promote (move to active sequence), keep (leave in backlog), or remove (delete).

### Seeds

Seeds are forward-looking ideas with trigger conditions. Unlike backlog items, seeds surface automatically when the right milestone arrives.

```
/gsd-capture --seed "Add real-time collab when WebSocket infra is in place"
```

Seeds preserve the full WHY and WHEN to surface. `/gsd-new-milestone` scans all seeds and presents matches.

**Storage:** `.planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md`

### Persistent Context Threads

Threads are lightweight cross-session knowledge stores for work that spans multiple sessions but doesn't belong to any specific phase.

```
/gsd-thread                              # List all threads
/gsd-thread fix-deploy-key-auth          # Resume existing thread
/gsd-thread "Investigate TCP timeout"    # Create new thread
```

Threads are lighter weight than `/gsd-pause-work` — no phase state, no plan context. Each thread file includes Goal, Context, References, and Next Steps sections.

Threads can be promoted to phases (`/gsd-phase`) or backlog items (`/gsd-capture --backlog`) when they mature.

**Storage:** `.planning/threads/{slug}.md`

---

## Workstreams

Workstreams let you work on multiple milestone areas concurrently without state collisions. Each workstream gets its own isolated `.planning/` state, so switching between them doesn't clobber progress.

**When to use:** You're working on milestone features that span different concern areas (e.g., backend API and frontend dashboard) and want to plan, execute, or discuss them independently without context bleed.

### Commands


| Command                            | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/gsd-workstreams create <name>`   | Create a new workstream with isolated planning state |
| `/gsd-workstreams switch <name>`   | Switch active context to a different workstream      |
| `/gsd-workstreams list`            | Show all workstreams and which is active             |
| `/gsd-workstreams complete <name>` | Mark a workstream as done and archive its state      |


### How It Works

Each workstream maintains its own `.planning/` directory subtree. When you switch workstreams, GSD swaps the active planning context so that `/gsd-progress`, `/gsd-discuss-phase`, `/gsd-plan-phase`, and other commands operate on that workstream's state. Active context is session-scoped when the runtime exposes a stable session identifier, which prevents one terminal or AI instance from repointing another instance's `STATE.md`.

This is lighter weight than `/gsd-workspace --new` (which creates separate repo worktrees). Workstreams share the same codebase and git history but isolate planning artifacts.

## Security

### Defense-in-Depth (v1.27)

GSD generates markdown files that become LLM system prompts. This means any user-controlled text flowing into planning artifacts is a potential indirect prompt injection vector. v1.27 introduced centralized security hardening:

**Path Traversal Prevention:**
All user-supplied file paths (`--text-file`, `--prd`) are validated to resolve within the project directory. macOS `/var` → `/private/var` symlink resolution is handled.

**Prompt Injection Detection:**
The `security.cjs` module scans for known injection patterns (role overrides, instruction bypasses, system tag injections) in user-supplied text before it enters planning artifacts.

**Runtime Hooks:**

- `gsd-prompt-guard.js` — Scans Write/Edit calls to `.planning/` for injection patterns (always active, advisory-only)
- `gsd-workflow-guard.js` — Warns on file edits outside GSD workflow context (opt-in via `hooks.workflow_guard`)

**CI Scanner:**
`prompt-injection-scan.test.cjs` scans all agent, workflow, and command files for embedded injection vectors. Run as part of the test suite.

### Package Legitimacy Gate (v1.42.1)

AI coding tools hallucinate package names. Attackers pre-register those names on npm, PyPI, and crates.io with malicious post-install scripts — a technique called *slopsquatting*. A hallucinated name that passes `npm view` looks legitimate, so it would flow undetected through GSD's research → plan → execute pipeline all the way to `npm install <malicious-pkg>` running on your machine.

v1.42.1 adds a three-layer gate that stops this before it reaches your shell.

#### What you'll see

**In RESEARCH.md** — every phase that recommends external packages now includes a `## Package Legitimacy Audit` table:

```markdown
## Package Legitimacy Audit

| Package | Registry | Age | Downloads | Source Repo | slopcheck | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| express | npm | 13 yrs | 100M+/wk | github.com/expressjs/express | [OK] | Approved |
| some-new-util | npm | 3 days | 47 | none | [SLOP] | REMOVED |
| api-bridge | npm | 6 mo | 1.2k/wk | github.com/user/api-bridge | [SUS] | Flagged |

**Packages removed due to slopcheck:** some-new-util
**Packages flagged as suspicious:** api-bridge — planner will require human verification before install
```

`[SLOP]` packages are removed from RESEARCH.md entirely. They never reach the planner.

**In PLAN.md** — if a package is tagged `[ASSUMED]` (sourced from WebSearch, not registry-verified) or `[SUS]` (slopcheck suspicious), the plan includes a verification checkpoint *before* the install task:

```xml
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">
  <what-built>Package verification required before install</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Verify these packages before proceeding:
    - `api-bridge` [SUS — 6 months old, 1.2k downloads/week, GitHub repo present]
      Check: https://npmjs.com/package/api-bridge
      Look for: maintainer history, issue tracker activity, no suspicious install scripts
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "verified" once you've confirmed all packages are legitimate</resume-signal>
</task>
```

**During execution** — if an install fails, the executor surfaces a checkpoint and stops. It does not silently try a similarly-named alternative (which could be even more dangerous).

#### Slopcheck verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning | GSD action |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `[OK]` | Package passes all legitimacy checks | Proceeds — no checkpoint added |
| `[SUS]` | Suspicious signals (new, low downloads, no source repo, etc.) | Flagged in Audit table; planner adds `checkpoint:human-verify` before install |
| `[SLOP]` | High-confidence hallucination or attacker-registered package | Removed from RESEARCH.md; never reaches planner |

#### Claim provenance and WebSearch packages

Package names discovered through WebSearch are always tagged `[ASSUMED]` in RESEARCH.md, regardless of whether `npm view` succeeds. A package that exists on the registry is not the same as a package that's safe to install — `npm view` only proves registration, not legitimacy.

`[ASSUMED]` packages trigger the same `checkpoint:human-verify` gate as `[SUS]` packages. You'll see the checkpoint with a link to the registry page and guidance on what to look for.

#### If slopcheck isn't installed

GSD attempts `pip install slopcheck` at research time. If that fails:

- Every recommended package is tagged `[ASSUMED]`
- The planner gates every install with a `checkpoint:human-verify` task
- Research and planning complete normally — nothing hard-fails

This is intentionally stricter than the normal flow: slopcheck unavailability means every package install gets a human checkpoint, which is the safest fallback.

To install slopcheck manually:

```bash
pip install slopcheck
# verify: slopcheck install express --json
```

#### slopcheck dependency

`slopcheck` is a MIT-licensed Python tool maintained by ToxSec (the researcher who documented the slopsquatting attack surface). It checks packages across npm, PyPI, crates.io, RubyGems, Go modules, Maven, and Packagist using multi-signal heuristics: registry age, download count, source-repo linkage, naming distance to popular packages, and registry-specific suspicion patterns.

If `slopcheck` is ever unavailable or abandoned, GSD's `[ASSUMED]`-gate fallback ensures you always get a human checkpoint before any install — the system never silently degrades to the pre-v1.42.1 behavior.

## Code Review Workflow

### Phase Code Review

After executing a phase, run a structured code review before UAT:

```bash
/gsd-code-review 3               # Review all changed files in phase 3
/gsd-code-review 3 --depth=deep  # Deep cross-file review (import graphs, call chains)
```

The reviewer scopes files automatically using SUMMARY.md (preferred) or git diff fallback. Findings are classified as Critical, Warning, or Info in `{phase}-REVIEW.md`.

```bash
/gsd-code-review 3 --fix           # Fix Critical + Warning findings atomically
/gsd-code-review 3 --fix --auto    # Fix and re-review until clean (max 3 iterations)
```

### Autonomous Audit-to-Fix

To run an audit and fix all auto-fixable issues in one pass:

```bash
/gsd-audit-fix                   # Audit + classify + fix (medium+ severity, max 5)
/gsd-audit-fix --dry-run         # Preview classification without fixing
```

### Code Review in the Full Phase Lifecycle

The review step slots in after execution and before UAT:

```
/gsd-execute-phase N   ->  /gsd-code-review N  ->  /gsd-code-review N --fix  ->  /gsd-verify-work N
```

---

## Exploration & Discovery

### Socratic Exploration

Before committing to a new phase or plan, use `/gsd-explore` to think through the idea:

```bash
/gsd-explore                           # Open-ended ideation
/gsd-explore "caching strategy"        # Explore a specific topic
```

The exploration session guides you through probing questions, optionally spawns a research agent, and routes output to the appropriate GSD artifact: note, todo, seed, research question, requirements update, or new phase.

### Codebase Intelligence

For queryable codebase insights without reading the entire codebase, enable the intel system:

```json
{ "intel": { "enabled": true } }
```

Then build the index:

```bash
/gsd-map-codebase --query refresh             # Analyze codebase and write .planning/intel/ files
/gsd-map-codebase --query auth               # Search for a term across all intel files
/gsd-map-codebase --query status             # Check freshness of intel files
/gsd-map-codebase --query diff               # See what changed since last snapshot
```

Intel files cover stack, API surface, dependency graph, file roles, and architecture decisions.

### Quick Scan

For a focused assessment without full `/gsd-map-codebase` overhead:

```bash
/gsd-map-codebase --fast                        # Quick tech + arch overview
/gsd-map-codebase --fast --focus quality        # Quality and code health only
/gsd-map-codebase --fast --focus concerns       # Risk areas and concerns
```

## Command And Configuration Reference

- **Command Reference:** see [`docs/COMMANDS.md`](COMMANDS.md) for every stable command's flags, subcommands, and examples. The authoritative shipped-command roster lives in [`docs/INVENTORY.md`](INVENTORY.md#commands-75-shipped).
- **Configuration Reference:** see [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) for the full `config.json` schema, every setting's default and provenance, the per-agent model-profile table (including the `inherit` option for non-Claude runtimes), git branching strategies, and security settings.
- **Discuss Mode:** see [`docs/workflow-discuss-mode.md`](workflow-discuss-mode.md) for interview vs assumptions mode.

This guide intentionally does not re-document commands or config settings: maintaining two copies previously produced drift (`workflow.discuss_mode`'s default, `claude_md_path`'s default, the model-profile table's agent coverage). The single-source-of-truth rule is enforced mechanically by the drift-guard tests anchored on `docs/INVENTORY.md`.

<!-- The Command Reference table previously here duplicated docs/COMMANDS.md; removed to stop drift. -->
<!-- The Configuration Reference subsection (core settings, planning, workflow toggles, hooks, git branching, model profiles) previously here duplicated docs/CONFIGURATION.md; removed to stop drift. The `resolve_model_ids` ghost key that appeared only in this file's abbreviated schema is retired with the duplicate. -->

## Usage Examples

### New Project (Full Cycle)

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
/gsd-new-project            # Answer questions, configure, approve roadmap
/clear
/gsd-discuss-phase 1        # Lock in your preferences
/gsd-ui-phase 1             # Design contract (frontend phases)
/gsd-plan-phase 1           # Research + plan + verify
/gsd-execute-phase 1        # Parallel execution
/gsd-verify-work 1          # Manual UAT
/gsd-ship 1                 # Create PR from verified work
/gsd-ui-review 1            # Visual audit (frontend phases)
/clear
/gsd-progress --next                   # Auto-detect and run next step
...
/gsd-audit-milestone        # Check everything shipped
/gsd-complete-milestone     # Archive, tag, done
/gsd-pause-work --report         # Generate session summary
```

### New Project from Existing Document

```bash
/gsd-new-project --auto @prd.md   # Auto-runs research/requirements/roadmap from your doc
/clear
/gsd-discuss-phase 1               # Normal flow from here
```

### Existing Codebase

```bash
/gsd-map-codebase           # Analyze what exists (parallel agents)
/gsd-new-project            # Questions focus on what you're ADDING
# (normal phase workflow from here)
```

**Post-execute drift detection (#2003).** After every `/gsd-execute-phase`,
GSD checks whether the phase introduced enough structural change
(new directories, barrel exports, migrations, or route modules) to make
`.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md` stale. If it did, the default behavior is
to print a one-shot warning suggesting the exact `/gsd-map-codebase --paths …`
invocation to refresh just the affected subtrees. Flip the behavior with:

```bash
/gsd-settings workflow.drift_action auto-remap       # remap automatically
/gsd-settings workflow.drift_threshold 5             # tune sensitivity
```

The gate is non-blocking: any internal failure logs and the phase continues.

### Quick Bug Fix

```bash
/gsd-quick
> "Fix the login button not responding on mobile Safari"
```

### Resuming After a Break

```bash
/gsd-progress               # See where you left off and what's next
# or
/gsd-resume-work            # Full context restoration from last session
```

### Preparing for Release

```bash
/gsd-audit-milestone        # Check requirements coverage, detect stubs
/gsd-complete-milestone     # Archive, tag, done
```

### Speed vs Quality Presets


| Scenario    | Mode          | Granularity | Profile    | Research | Plan Check | Verifier |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Prototyping | `yolo`        | `coarse`    | `budget`   | off      | off        | off      |
| Normal dev  | `interactive` | `standard`  | `balanced` | on       | on         | on       |
| Production  | `interactive` | `fine`      | `quality`  | on       | on         | on       |


**Skipping discuss-phase in autonomous mode:** When running in `yolo` mode with well-established preferences already captured in PROJECT.md, set `workflow.skip_discuss: true` via `/gsd-settings`. This bypasses the discuss-phase entirely and writes a minimal CONTEXT.md derived from the ROADMAP phase goal. Useful when your PROJECT.md and conventions are comprehensive enough that discussion adds no new information.

### Mid-Milestone Scope Changes

```bash
/gsd-phase                  # Append a new phase to the roadmap (default mode)
# or
/gsd-phase --insert 3       # Insert urgent work between phases 3 and 4
# or
/gsd-phase --remove 7       # Descope phase 7 and renumber
# or
/gsd-phase --edit 4         # Edit any field of phase 4 in place
```

### Multi-Project Workspaces

Work on multiple repos or features in parallel with isolated GSD state.

```bash
# Create a workspace with repos from your monorepo
/gsd-workspace --new --name feature-b --repos hr-ui,ZeymoAPI

# Feature branch isolation — worktree of current repo with its own .planning/
/gsd-workspace --new --name feature-b --repos .

# Then cd into the workspace and initialize GSD
cd ~/gsd-workspaces/feature-b
/gsd-new-project

# List and manage workspaces
/gsd-workspace --list
/gsd-workspace --remove feature-b
```

Each workspace gets:

- Its own `.planning/` directory (fully independent from source repos)
- Git worktrees (default) or clones of specified repos
- A `WORKSPACE.md` manifest tracking member repos

---

## Troubleshooting

### Programmatic CLI (`gsd-sdk query` vs `gsd-tools.cjs`)

For automation and copy-paste from docs, prefer **`gsd-sdk query`** with a registered subcommand (see [CLI-TOOLS.md — SDK and programmatic access](CLI-TOOLS.md#sdk-and-programmatic-access) and [QUERY-HANDLERS.md](../sdk/src/query/QUERY-HANDLERS.md)). The legacy `node $HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` CLI remains supported for dual-mode operation.

**CLI-only (not in the query registry):** **graphify**, **from-gsd2** / **gsd2-import** — call `gsd-tools.cjs` (see [QUERY-HANDLERS.md](../sdk/src/query/QUERY-HANDLERS.md)). **Two different `state` JSON shapes in the legacy CLI:** `state json` (frontmatter rebuild) vs `state load` (`config` + `state_raw` + flags). **`gsd-sdk query` today:** both `state.json` and `state.load` resolve to the frontmatter-rebuild handler — use `node …/gsd-tools.cjs state load` when you need the CJS `state load` shape. See [CLI-TOOLS.md](CLI-TOOLS.md#sdk-and-programmatic-access) and QUERY-HANDLERS.

### STATE.md Out of Sync

If STATE.md shows incorrect phase status or position, use the state consistency commands (**CJS-only** until ported to the query layer):

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state validate          # Detect drift between STATE.md and filesystem
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state sync --verify     # Preview what sync would change
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state sync              # Reconstruct STATE.md from disk
```

These commands are new in v1.32 and replace manual STATE.md editing.

### Read-Before-Edit Infinite Retry Loop

Some non-Claude runtimes (Cline, Augment Code) may enter an infinite retry loop when an agent attempts to edit a file it hasn't read. The `gsd-read-before-edit.js` hook (v1.32) detects this pattern and advises reading the file first. If your runtime doesn't support PreToolUse hooks, add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Edit Safety Rule
Always read a file before editing it. Never call Edit or Write on a file you haven't read in this session.
```

### "Project already initialized"

You ran `/gsd-new-project` but `.planning/PROJECT.md` already exists. This is a safety check. If you want to start over, delete the `.planning/` directory first.

### Context Degradation During Long Sessions

Clear your context window between major commands: `/clear` in Claude Code. GSD is designed around fresh contexts -- every subagent gets a clean 200K window. If quality is dropping in the main session, clear and use `/gsd-resume-work` or `/gsd-progress` to restore state.

### Plans Seem Wrong or Misaligned

Run `/gsd-discuss-phase [N]` before planning. Most plan quality issues come from Claude making assumptions that `CONTEXT.md` would have prevented. You can also run `/gsd-discuss-phase --assumptions [N]` to see what Claude intends to do before committing to a plan.

### Discuss-Phase Uses Technical Jargon I Don't Understand

`/gsd-discuss-phase` adapts its language based on your `USER-PROFILE.md`. If the profile indicates a non-technical owner — `learning_style: guided`, `jargon` listed as a frustration trigger, or `explanation_depth: high-level` — gray area questions are automatically reframed in product-outcome language instead of implementation terminology.

To enable this: run `/gsd-profile-user` to generate your profile. The profile is stored at `~/.claude/get-shit-done/USER-PROFILE.md` and is read automatically on every `/gsd-discuss-phase` invocation. No other configuration is required.

### Execution Fails or Produces Stubs

Check that the plan was not too ambitious. Plans should have 2-3 tasks maximum. If tasks are too large, they exceed what a single context window can produce reliably. Re-plan with smaller scope.

### Lost Track of Where You Are

Run `/gsd-progress`. It reads all state files and tells you exactly where you are and what to do next.

### Need to Change Something After Execution

Do not re-run `/gsd-execute-phase`. Use `/gsd-quick` for targeted fixes, or `/gsd-verify-work` to systematically identify and fix issues through UAT.

### Model Costs Too High

Switch to budget profile: `/gsd-config --profile budget`. Disable research and plan-check agents via `/gsd-settings` if the domain is familiar to you (or to Claude).

### Tuning model cost by phase (`models`) — added in v1.40

If you've heard "use Opus for planning, Sonnet for verification" and want to apply that without learning the agent taxonomy, add a `models` block to `.planning/config.json`:

```json
{
  "model_profile": "balanced",
  "models": {
    "planning": "opus",
    "discuss": "opus",
    "research": "sonnet",
    "execution": "opus",
    "verification": "sonnet",
    "completion": "sonnet"
  }
}
```

The six slots (`planning` / `discuss` / `research` / `execution` / `verification` / `completion`) accept tier aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`). Each slot covers a group of agents — for example, setting `models.research = "sonnet"` applies to `gsd-phase-researcher`, `gsd-codebase-mapper`, `gsd-research-synthesizer`, and the other research agents in one shot.

Need a per-agent exception? Add `model_overrides` alongside — it wins over `models`:

```json
{
  "models": { "research": "sonnet" },
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-codebase-mapper": "haiku"
  }
}
```

That gives sonnet to all research agents *except* the codebase mapper, which runs haiku for the cheap-but-broad fan-out scan.

### Cheap-by-default with `dynamic_routing` — added in v1.40

If you've been paying Opus rates everywhere as insurance against a single hard verification, dynamic routing flips it: every agent starts on a cheaper tier and escalates only when the orchestrator marks a soft failure (verification inconclusive, plan-check FLAG, etc.).

```json
{
  "dynamic_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tier_models": {
      "light":    "haiku",
      "standard": "sonnet",
      "heavy":    "opus"
    },
    "escalate_on_failure": true,
    "max_escalations": 1
  }
}
```

Each agent has a default tier (`light`, `standard`, or `heavy`). On the first attempt, GSD picks `tier_models[default_tier]`. If the orchestrator detects a soft failure, it re-spawns once at the next tier up. `max_escalations` caps total retries so a runaway loop can't burn through your budget.

Concretely:
- `gsd-codebase-mapper` (default `light`) → first attempt = `haiku`. If escalated → `sonnet`.
- `gsd-verifier` (default `standard`) → first attempt = `sonnet`. If escalated → `opus`.
- `gsd-planner` (default `heavy`) → always `opus`. No tier above; can't escalate further.

To turn it off, set `dynamic_routing.enabled: false` (the default) — behavior is identical to today.

For the full agent → tier mapping and resolution-precedence rules, see [Dynamic Routing](CONFIGURATION.md#dynamic-routing-with-failure-tier-escalation-dynamic_routing--added-in-v140) in the configuration reference.

### Trim MCP servers to reduce per-turn cost (the biggest lever GSD doesn't own)

Before tuning `model_profile` or `models.<phase_type>`, audit which **MCP servers** your harness has enabled. Every enabled MCP server injects its tool schema into every turn — heavyweight servers like browser/playwright tools or platform-specific helpers can cost 20k+ tokens each, often dwarfing whatever GSD's resolver can save.

This is a **harness setting**, not a GSD setting. The toggle lives in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["context7"],
  "disabledMcpjsonServers": ["playwright", "mac-tools"]
}
```

Quick audit before a long phase:

- Are any browser / playwright tools enabled when this phase has no UI work?
- Are any platform-specific tools (Mac-tools, Windows-tools, OS-specific) enabled when not needed?
- Are any project-specific MCPs from a different project still enabled here?

Each disabled server removes its schema from every subsequent turn for the rest of the session. Trimming MCPs **compounds** with `model_profile` tuning — both levers are additive, and MCP savings show up immediately across every subagent the orchestrator spawns.

For the full audit, harness reference, and the composition note with `model_profile`, see [MCP Tool Schema Cost](../get-shit-done/references/context-budget.md#mcp-tool-schema-cost-harness-concern) in the bundled `context-budget.md` reference.

### Using Non-Claude Runtimes (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kilo)

> **Codex CLI minimum supported version: `0.130.0`** (issue [#3562](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/issues/3562)).
>
> Codex CLI [0.130.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.130.0) (released 2026-05-08) removed extra-skills-roots discovery via [openai/codex#21485](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/21485). From that version onward, Codex only discovers commands from `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user root), `<project>/.codex/skills/` (cwd root), and registered plugin roots. The GSD installer writes `~/.codex/skills/gsd-<name>/SKILL.md` directly so `$gsd-help`, `$gsd-new-project`, etc. are discoverable after restart.
>
> **Earlier Codex CLI versions** (pre-0.130.0) had additional skill-root scanning that discovered the GSD agent/workflow files in alternate locations. GSD still installs the `~/.codex/skills/gsd-*` copies on those versions, which can show a duplicate listing alongside the legacy auto-discovered surface — restart Codex after install and either upgrade to ≥ 0.130.0 or accept the duplicate entries until you do.

If you installed GSD for a non-Claude runtime, the installer already configured model resolution so all agents use the runtime's default model. No manual setup is needed. Specifically, the installer sets `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` in your config, which tells GSD to skip Anthropic model ID resolution and let the runtime choose its own default model.

To assign different models to different agents on a non-Claude runtime, add `model_overrides` to `.planning/config.json` with fully-qualified model IDs that your runtime recognizes:

```json
{
  "resolve_model_ids": "omit",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-planner": "o3",
    "gsd-executor": "o4-mini",
    "gsd-debugger": "o3"
  }
}
```

The installer auto-configures `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` for Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Kilo, and Codex. If you're manually setting up a non-Claude runtime, add it to `.planning/config.json` yourself.

#### Switching from Claude to Codex with one config change (#2517)

If you want tiered models on Codex without writing a large `model_overrides` block, set `runtime: "codex"` and pick a profile:

```json
{
  "runtime": "codex",
  "model_profile": "balanced"
}
```

GSD will resolve each agent's tier (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) to the Codex-native model and reasoning effort defined in the runtime tier map (`gpt-5.4` xhigh / `gpt-5.3-codex` medium / `gpt-5.4-mini` medium). The Codex installer embeds both `model` and `model_reasoning_effort` into each agent's TOML automatically. To override a single tier, add `model_profile_overrides.codex.<tier>`. See [Runtime-Aware Profiles](CONFIGURATION.md#runtime-aware-profiles-2517).

See the [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md#non-claude-runtimes-codex-opencode-gemini-cli-kilo) for the full explanation.

### Installing for Cline

Cline uses a rules-based integration — GSD installs as `.clinerules` rather than slash commands.

```bash
# Global install (applies to all projects)
npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux --cline --global

# Local install (this project only)
npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux --cline --local
```

Global installs write to `~/.cline/`. Local installs write to `./.cline/`. No custom slash commands are registered — GSD rules are loaded automatically by Cline from the rules file.

### Installing for CodeBuddy

CodeBuddy uses a skills-based integration.

```bash
npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux --codebuddy --global
```

Skills are installed to `~/.codebuddy/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`.

### Installing for Qwen Code

Qwen Code uses the same open skills standard as Claude Code 2.1.88+.

```bash
npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux --qwen --global
```

Skills are installed to `~/.qwen/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`. Use the `QWEN_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to override the default install path.

### Installing for Prerelease Editions (Next / Nightly / Insiders / Preview)

Many supported runtimes ship a prerelease edition alongside their stable release — Windsurf Next, Cursor Nightly, VS Code Insiders, Codex preview channels, JetBrains EAP, and so on. Prerelease editions read from a sibling configuration directory, so the default install path won't reach them.

GSD does not enumerate prerelease editions as separate named runtimes. They are accommodated through the existing `<RUNTIME>_CONFIG_DIR` environment variables and the free-string runtime policy (see [#2517](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/issues/2517)) — installs work, paths resolve, GSD operates. Prerelease editions are **best-effort and not separately tested** as part of release CI.

**Pattern.** Set the runtime's `*_CONFIG_DIR` env var to the prerelease directory before running the installer:

```bash
WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR=~/.codeium/windsurf-next npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux@latest --windsurf --global
```

Select the corresponding stable runtime in the installer prompt. Skills land in the prerelease directory; commands appear in the prerelease editor.

**Env-var reference for supported runtimes:**

| Runtime | Stable default | Override env var |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini` | `GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR` |
| OpenCode | `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Codex | (per Codex CLI) | `--config-dir` flag |
| Copilot | `~/.copilot` | `COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor` | `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf` | `WINDSURF_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity` | `ANTIGRAVITY_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Augment | `~/.augment` | `AUGMENT_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Trae | `~/.trae` | `TRAE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen` | `QWEN_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Kilo | `~/.config/kilo` | `KILO_CONFIG_DIR` |
| CodeBuddy | `~/.codebuddy` | `CODEBUDDY_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Cline | `~/.cline` | `CLINE_CONFIG_DIR` |

If your runtime's prerelease channel is not listed, point the matching env var at its config directory and file an issue if the install fails for any reason other than the path mapping.

### Using Claude Code with Non-Anthropic Providers (OpenRouter, Local)

If GSD subagents call Anthropic models and you're paying through OpenRouter or a local provider, switch to the `inherit` profile: `/gsd-config --profile inherit`. This makes all agents use your current session model instead of specific Anthropic models. See also `/gsd-settings` → Model Profile → Inherit.

### Working on a Sensitive/Private Project

Set `commit_docs: false` during `/gsd-new-project` or via `/gsd-settings`. Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`. Planning artifacts stay local and never touch git.

### GSD Update Overwrote My Local Changes

Since v1.17, the installer backs up locally modified files to `gsd-local-patches/`. Run `/gsd-update --reapply` to merge your changes back.

### Cannot Update via npm

If `npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux` fails due to npm outages or network restrictions, see [docs/manual-update.md](manual-update.md) for a step-by-step manual update procedure that works without npm access.

### Surface GSD Update Notifications Without GSD's Statusline

GSD checks for new versions in the background and writes the result to `~/.cache/gsd/gsd-update-check.json`. By default, GSD's statusline (`hooks/gsd-statusline.js`) reads that cache and shows the update indicator. If you use a different statusline (for example `ccstatusline`) or none at all, the update info is invisible.

**Opt-in fix:** during interactive install, when you decline (or keep your existing) statusline, the installer offers a one-time prompt:

```text
Optional: GSD update banner
  1) No banner (default)
  2) Install update banner
```

Choose `2` (or type `y`/`yes`) and the installer registers `hooks/gsd-update-banner.js` as a `SessionStart` hook. From the next session onward, GSD prints a one-line `systemMessage` only when the cache reports an update available:

```text
GSD update available: 1.39.0 → 1.40.0. Run /gsd-update.
```

The banner is silent when no update is available. If the cache file is corrupt, GSD emits one diagnostic line (`GSD update check failed.`) and stays silent for 24 hours so a broken cache does not nag every session.

**Opt-out / removal:** delete the SessionStart hook entry that references `gsd-update-banner.js` from your runtime's `settings.json` (Claude Code: `~/.claude/settings.json`; Gemini: `~/.gemini/settings.json`). `npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux --uninstall` removes both the script and the registration in one pass.

The banner is not offered when GSD's statusline is installed — that channel already surfaces update info, so re-prompting would be noise.

### Workflow Diagnostics (`/gsd-forensics`)

When a workflow fails in a way that isn't obvious -- plans reference nonexistent files, execution produces unexpected results, or state seems corrupted -- run `/gsd-forensics` to generate a diagnostic report.

**What it checks:**

- Git history anomalies (orphaned commits, unexpected branch state, rebase artifacts)
- Artifact integrity (missing or malformed planning files, broken cross-references)
- State inconsistencies (ROADMAP status vs. actual file presence, config drift)

**Output:** A diagnostic report written to `.planning/forensics/` with findings and suggested remediation steps.

### Executor Subagent Gets "Permission denied" on Bash Commands

GSD's `gsd-executor` subagents need write-capable Bash access to a project's standard tooling — `git commit`, `bin/rails`, `bundle exec`, `npm run`, `uv run`, and similar commands. Claude Code's default `~/.claude/settings.json` only allows a narrow set of read-only git commands, so a fresh install will hit "Permission to use Bash has been denied" the first time an executor tries to make a commit or run a build tool.

**Fix: add the required patterns to `~/.claude/settings.json`.**

The patterns you need depend on your stack. Copy the block for your stack and add it to the `permissions.allow` array.

#### Required for all stacks (git + gh)

```json
"Bash(git add:*)",
"Bash(git commit:*)",
"Bash(git merge:*)",
"Bash(git worktree:*)",
"Bash(git rebase:*)",
"Bash(git reset:*)",
"Bash(git checkout:*)",
"Bash(git switch:*)",
"Bash(git restore:*)",
"Bash(git stash:*)",
"Bash(git rm:*)",
"Bash(git mv:*)",
"Bash(git fetch:*)",
"Bash(git cherry-pick:*)",
"Bash(git apply:*)",
"Bash(gh:*)"
```

#### Rails / Ruby

```json
"Bash(bin/rails:*)",
"Bash(bin/brakeman:*)",
"Bash(bin/bundler-audit:*)",
"Bash(bin/importmap:*)",
"Bash(bundle:*)",
"Bash(rubocop:*)",
"Bash(erb_lint:*)"
```

#### Python / uv

```json
"Bash(uv:*)",
"Bash(python:*)",
"Bash(pytest:*)",
"Bash(ruff:*)",
"Bash(mypy:*)"
```

#### Node / npm / pnpm / bun

```json
"Bash(npm:*)",
"Bash(npx:*)",
"Bash(pnpm:*)",
"Bash(bun:*)",
"Bash(node:*)"
```

#### Rust / Cargo

```json
"Bash(cargo:*)"
```

**Example `~/.claude/settings.json` snippet (Rails project):**

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Write",
      "Edit",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git merge:*)",
      "Bash(git worktree:*)",
      "Bash(git rebase:*)",
      "Bash(git reset:*)",
      "Bash(git checkout:*)",
      "Bash(git switch:*)",
      "Bash(git restore:*)",
      "Bash(git stash:*)",
      "Bash(git rm:*)",
      "Bash(git mv:*)",
      "Bash(git fetch:*)",
      "Bash(git cherry-pick:*)",
      "Bash(git apply:*)",
      "Bash(gh:*)",
      "Bash(bin/rails:*)",
      "Bash(bin/brakeman:*)",
      "Bash(bin/bundler-audit:*)",
      "Bash(bundle:*)",
      "Bash(rubocop:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Per-project permissions (scoped to one repo):** If you prefer to allow these patterns for a single project rather than globally, add the same `permissions.allow` block to `.claude/settings.local.json` in your project root instead of `~/.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code checks project-local settings first.

**Interactive guidance:** When an executor is blocked mid-phase, it will identify the exact pattern needed (e.g. `"Bash(bin/rails:*)"`) so you can add it and re-run `/gsd-execute-phase`.

### Subagent Appears to Fail but Work Was Done

A known workaround exists for a Claude Code classification bug. GSD's orchestrators (execute-phase, quick) spot-check actual output before reporting failure. If you see a failure message but commits were made, check `git log` -- the work may have succeeded.

### Parallel Execution Causes Build Lock Errors

If you see pre-commit hook failures, cargo lock contention, or 30+ minute execution times during parallel wave execution, this is caused by multiple agents triggering build tools simultaneously. GSD handles this automatically since v1.26 — parallel agents use `--no-verify` on commits and the orchestrator runs hooks once after each wave. If you're on an older version, add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Git Commit Rules for Agents
All subagent/executor commits MUST use `--no-verify`.
```

To disable parallel execution entirely: `/gsd-settings` → set `parallelization.enabled` to `false`.

### Windows: Installation Crashes on Protected Directories

If the installer crashes with `EPERM: operation not permitted, scandir` on Windows, this is caused by OS-protected directories (e.g., Chromium browser profiles). Fixed since v1.24 — update to the latest version. As a workaround, temporarily rename the problematic directory before running the installer.
