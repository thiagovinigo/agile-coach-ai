/**
 * Regression test for bug #2980
 *
 * The release-sdk hotfix cherry-pick loop's `fix:`/`chore:` filter is
 * too broad: it picks anything with that conventional-commit type
 * regardless of whether the diff can affect the published npm package.
 * That caused two compounding problems:
 *
 *   1. CI-only fixes (release-sdk.yml, hotfix tooling) were cherry-picked
 *      into hotfix branches even though they cannot change what ships.
 *   2. The subset of those CI-only fixes touching `.github/workflows/*`
 *      caused the prepare job's `git push` to be rejected by GitHub —
 *      the default GITHUB_TOKEN lacks the `workflow` scope:
 *
 *         ! [remote rejected] hotfix/X.YY.Z -> hotfix/X.YY.Z
 *           (refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
 *            ... without `workflows` permission)
 *
 *      v1.39.1 hit this on PR #2977 (run 25232010071): #2977 cherry-
 *      picked cleanly because earlier workflow-file fixes had been
 *      skipped on conflict, then the push exploded.
 *
 * Fix (root cause): pre-pick guard that checks whether the candidate
 * commit's diff intersects the npm tarball's shipped paths (entries in
 * `package.json` `files` plus `package.json` itself). Non-shipping
 * commits are skipped with an informational summary entry; the
 * workflow-file rejection is now a non-issue because workflow files
 * are not in `files`.
 *
 * The shipped-paths classifier lives in
 * `scripts/diff-touches-shipped-paths.cjs` rather than inline in the
 * workflow YAML so its rules are unit-testable.
 *
 * This test covers two layers:
 *   - Static workflow assertions (the loop calls the script before
 *     attempting the pick, the result drives a NON_SHIPPED_SKIPPED
 *     bucket, and the run summary surfaces it).
 *   - Behavioral assertions on the classifier script itself (matches
 *     `npm pack` semantics for `files` entries).
